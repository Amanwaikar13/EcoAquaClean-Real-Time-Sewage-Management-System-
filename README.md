# EcoAquaClean-Real-Time-Sewage-Management-System-

The Real-Time Sewage Management System is designed to monitor and manage sewage conditions through real-time data collection using Tobodo Sen water level sensor, Arduino, and Tobodo Sen MQ air quality sensor. By utilizing advanced machine learning techniques for data analysis and a secure cloud architecture for data management, the system provides valuable insights for effective sewage management. Developed with Node.js and React.js, it features a user-friendly interface for interactive data visualization.

## Practical Implementation
I have conducted practical sessions to implement this system, capturing real-time data using sensors and processing it for meaningful insights. Below are the images from the practical sessions:
